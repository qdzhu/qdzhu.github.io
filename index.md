# About

I am currently a NOAA Climate & Global Change (C&GC) postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. Arlene Fiore at MIT since August 2022. My research centers on climate-chemistry interaction. I study hydroxyl radical (OH) since OH lies at the nexus of climate and air quality as the primary oxidant for both reactive greenhouse gases and many hazardous air pollutants.

In the meanwhile, I collaborate with NOAA CSL on developing a new chemical mechanism, RACM2B-VCP, for the regional chemistry transport model WRF-Chem. RACM2B-VCP is optimized to better represent VOC chemistry and address the impact of VCP and cooking emissions in urban areas such as Los Angelos. 

Previously, I earned a BS in Environmental Science and a double major BS in Mathematics from Peking University in 2017. I received a Ph.D. in Earth and Planetary Science with Prof. Ron Cohen from UC Berkeley in 2022. While at Berkely, I participated in the development of v3.0B of the [Berkeley High Resolution (BEHR) NO2 product] (http://cchem.behr.berkeley.edu/). Most of my Ph.D. has focused on utilizing satellite observations to obtain a better understanding of tropospheric chemistry, such as lightning NOx, and urban OH trends. I have also worked on a project that conducted airborne flux measurements to evaluate anthropogenic NOx emissions and estimate soil NOx emissions over San Joquin Valley.

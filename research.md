### Interpret continental-scale OH trends in climate models

![placeholder]([/assets/oh-trend-climate.png]) "OH trends in CESM2 climate model"

The hydroxyl radical (OH) lies at the nexus of climate and air quality as the primary oxidant for both reactive greenhouse gases and many hazardous air pollutants. The lifetime of methane, a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas causing about one-half of the warming of carbon dioxide since pre-industrial times, is largely set by the global integral of OH concentrations, which vary strongly in space and time.

To better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of OH, we utilize an existing 13-member ensemble of the CESM2-WACCM6 chemistry-climate coupled model spanning the years 1950 to 2014. We show a substantial spatial variation of historical trends of tropospheric column OH between 2005 and 2014. 

Therefore, we then use a machine learning (ML) technique, a fully connected neural network, to emulate annual mean tropospheric column OH and apply this emulator to identify the dominant drivers contributing to the regional variation in the OH trends.

### Develop RACM2B-VCP mechanism for WRF-Chem


Volatile organic compound (VOC) reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) fuel the production of air pollutants like ozone and particulate matter (PM). The representation of VOC chemistry remains challenging in reduced chemical mechanisms due to its complexity in speciation and reactions. We aim to develop a chemical mechanism that is compatible with WRF-Chem that better represents VOC chemistry in urban areas such as Los Angeles. We show that this chemical mechanism, RACM2B-VCP, is based on the RACM2_Berkeley2 mechanism and includes more complex oxygenated VOC chemistry to address the impact of VCP and cooking emissions. 

We will evaluate how well this RACM2B-VCP mechanism simulates VOC chemistry, ozone and PM2.5 in WRF-Chem by comparing against a series of observations, including airborne measurements from the RECAP-CA field campaign, mobile and in-situ measurements from the SUNVEX field campaign as well as AQS networks in summer 2021 over the LA Basin.

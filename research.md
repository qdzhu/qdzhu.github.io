## Ongoing research

### Interpret continental-scale OH trends in climate models

The hydroxyl radical (OH) lies at the nexus of climate and air quality as the primary oxidant for both reactive greenhouse gases and many hazardous air pollutants. The lifetime of methane, a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas causing about one-half of the warming of carbon dioxide since pre-industrial times, is largely set by the global integral of OH concentrations, which vary strongly in space and time.

To better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of OH, we utilize an existing 13-member ensemble of the CESM2-WACCM6 chemistry-climate coupled model spanning the years 1950 to 2014. We show a substantial spatial variation of historical trends of tropospheric column OH between 2005 and 2014. 

Therefore, we then use a machine learning (ML) technique, a fully connected neural network, to emulate annual mean tropospheric column OH and apply this emulator to identify the dominant drivers contributing to the regional variation in the OH trends.
